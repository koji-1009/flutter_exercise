# Flutter Excercise

This repository contains the following four flutter projects

* StatefulWidget + Push style navigation
* Provider + PushNamed style navigation
* Riverpod + Navigator 2 (go_router)
* Riverpod + flutter_hooks + Navigator 2 (go_router)

The purpose of this repository is to understand the differences between StatefulWidget, Provider, and Riverpod when used in an application.
There are some areas that are simple to implement in order to understand the differences rather than to judge superiority or inferiority.

CATAAS(Cat as a service) is used for API requests. Thanks for the nice API.
Note: that CATAAS may go down and the application may not work.
